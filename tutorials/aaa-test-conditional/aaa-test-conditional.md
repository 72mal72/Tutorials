[OPTION BEGIN [Windows]]

If you installed the VM installation package to a Windows machine, follow this step to update the `etc/hosts` file.

1.   On your Windows laptop, navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`

2.   In `Administrator` mode, open `hosts` in Notepad. See your operating system Help for information on opening applications in Administrator mode

3.   In a new uncommented row, add the IP address and `hxehost`. Save your changes

    Spacing is important. Make sure your hosts file in Notepad looks like this image.



    > Note:
    > If the VM is restarted and assigned a new IP, you'll need to update the Hosts file.
    >

[OPTION END]


[OPTION BEGIN [Mac and Linux]]

    sudo sh -c 'echo <hxehost IP address> hxehost >> /etc/hosts'
