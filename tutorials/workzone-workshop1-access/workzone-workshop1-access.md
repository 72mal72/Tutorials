## Details
### You will learn
  How to access SAP Work Zone


In this workshop tutorial mission, you'll be accessing the SAP Work Zone tutorial environment from a SAP BTP subaccount that has already been set up for you including a subscription to SAP Work Zone. Once you've accessed SAP Work Zone, in the next tutorial, you'll create a workspace and add content to it.

  >Please note that due to the high number of participants that register for SAP Work Zone workshops, we have provided a single subaccount for multiple users. Therefore, you will be using a shared subaccount with others. In order to allow the exercises to run smoothly for all, please don't edit the SAP Work Zone Home page as it's a shared asset.
