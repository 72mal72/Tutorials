## Details
### You will learn
  - How to open SAP standard apps like Mobile Cards, Fiori Client from MDK generic client
  - How to open an UI5 app running in a  Fiori Client from an MDK generic client
  - How to open a web page

---

Deep links are used to send users directly to an app instead of a website or a store saving users the time and energy locating a particular page themselves â€“ significantly improving the user experience.

If an app is already installed, you can specify a custom URL scheme (iOS Universal Links) or an intent URL (on Android devices) that opens that app. Using deep link, you can also navigate to specific events or pages, which could tie into campaigns that you may want to run.

![MDK](img_1.gif)

>**This tutorial has been executed using public store MDK client which has out of the box functionality to open SAP standard apps like SAP Mobile Cards and SAP Fiori Client.
If you are building a custom version of Mobile development kit client, there you can implement deep links by specifying related custom URL scheme.**

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Set up the application foundation)]

This step includes creating the Mobile Development Kit project in the Editor.

Launch the SAP Web IDE and select the **MDK perspective** by clicking on the icon in the left panel.

Right click on Workspace folder and select **New** | **MDK Empty Project**.

![MDK](img_001.png)

>The _MDK Empty Project_ template creates a Logout action, Close page action, rule and an empty page (`Main.page`). After using this template, you can focus on creating your pages, other actions, and rules needed for your application.

>More details on _MDK template_ is available in
[help documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/977416d43cd74bdc958289038749100e/Latest/en-US/cfd84e66bde44d8da09f250f1b8ecee6.html).

Enter the Project Name as `MDKDeepLink` and click **Next**.

![MDK](img_002.png)

Leave the default values in _Application Creation_ step as it is, click **Finish**.

![MDK](img_003.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create a new rule)]

In the MDK editor, you will create 4 new JavaScript files:

* `OpenSAPMobileCards.js` to open SAP Mobile Cards app
* `OpenSAPFioriClient.js` to open SAP Fiori Client app
* `OpenUI5.js` to open an UI5 app running in SAP Fiori Client app
* `OpenSAPcom.js` to open `SAP.com` web page

>You can find more details about [writing a Rule](https://help.sap.com/viewer/977416d43cd74bdc958289038749100e/Latest/en-US/ef1e3404ff5f4ca68676acbda10e4bd0.html).

Right click on the **Rules** folder | **New** | **File**.

![MDK](img_004.png)

Enter the file name `OpenSAPMobileCards.js`, click **OK**.

Copy and paste the following code.

```JavaScript
export default function openurl(clientAPI) {
// Get the Nativescript UI Dialogs Module
const dialogs = clientAPI.nativescript.uiDialogsModule;
// Get the Nativescript Utils Module
const utilsModule = clientAPI.nativescript.utilsModule;
return dialogs.confirm("Do you want to leave the current app?").then((result) => {
    if (result === true) {
        //This will open SAP Mobile Cards app
   return utilsModule.openUrl("com.sap.content2go://").then(	                
            (success) => Promise.resolve(success),
            (failure) => Promise.reject('The requested app or page is not available ' + failure));
    } else {
        return Promise.reject('User Deferred');
    }
});
}
```
![MDK](img_005.png)

>`openUrl` is a `NativeScript` API to open an URL on device. You can find more details about [this API](https://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/utils#openurl-function).

Repeat the above step and create another new file:

Enter the file name `OpenSAPFioriClient.js`, click **OK**.

Copy and paste the following code.

```JavaScript
export default function openurl(clientAPI) {
// Get the Nativescript UI Dialogs Module
const dialogs = clientAPI.nativescript.uiDialogsModule;
// Get the Nativescript Utils Module
const utilsModule = clientAPI.nativescript.utilsModule;
return dialogs.confirm("Do you want to leave the current app?").then((result) => {
    if (result === true) {
        //This will open SAP Fiori Client App
    return utilsModule.openUrl("com.sap.fiori.client.xcallbackurl://x-callback-url").then(               
            (success) => Promise.resolve(success),
            (failure) => Promise.reject('The requested app or page is not available ' + failure));
    } else {
        return Promise.reject('User Deferred');
    }
});
}
```

![MDK](img_006.png)

Repeat the above step and create another new file:

Enter the file name `OpenUI5.js`, click **OK**.

Copy and paste the following code.

```JavaScript
export default function openurl(clientAPI) {
// Get the Nativescript UI Dialogs Module
const dialogs = clientAPI.nativescript.uiDialogsModule;
// Get the Nativescript Utils Module
const utilsModule = clientAPI.nativescript.utilsModule;
return dialogs.confirm("Do you want to leave the current app?").then((result) => {
    if (result === true) {
        //This will open Software Downloads app running in SAP Fiori Client
return utilsModule.openUrl("com.sap.fiori.client.xcallbackurl://x-callback-url/openFioriUrl?url=https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/softwarecenter").then(                  
            (success) => Promise.resolve(success),
            (failure) => Promise.reject('The requested app or page is not available ' + failure));
    } else {
        return Promise.reject('User Deferred');
    }
});
}
```

![MDK](img_007.png)

Create one more file and name it to `OpenSAPcom.js`.

Copy and paste the following code.

```JavaScript
export default function openurl(clientAPI) {
// Get the Nativescript UI Dialogs Module
const dialogs = clientAPI.nativescript.uiDialogsModule;
// Get the Nativescript Utils Module
const utilsModule = clientAPI.nativescript.utilsModule;
return dialogs.confirm("Do you want to leave the current app?").then((result) => {
    if (result === true) {
        //This will open SAP.com website
return utilsModule.openUrl("https://www.sap.com").then( 	                
            (success) => Promise.resolve(success),
            (failure) => Promise.reject('The requested app or page is not available ' + failure));
    } else {
        return Promise.reject('User Deferred');
    }
});
}
```

Save the changes.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Add buttons on main page to open other apps/web pages)]

Next, on **Main page**, drag and drop the **Section Button Table** Container control onto the Page.

![MDK](img_009.gif)

>The controls available in Container section includes controls that act as containers for other controls, such as container items. A container is constant for all pages. The size of a container depends on the controls and contents included inside.  
You can find more details about [Containers](https://help.sap.com/viewer/977416d43cd74bdc958289038749100e/Latest/en-US/65c0ed1f448346cb89fa84992dc5df9c.html).

Now, you will add items to this Container control.

Drag and drop the **Section Button** Container Item control onto the page.

![MDK](img_010.gif)

Repeat the above step, and drag and drop 3 more such **Section Button** Container Item controls.

![MDK](img_011.png)

Select the first control and change its title to **Open SAP Mobile Cards**.

![MDK](img_012.png)

Repeat the above step and change the title for other controls as below:

![MDK](img_013.png)

Save the changes to `Main.page`.

[VALIDATE_1]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Set onPress handler to the buttons)]

In this step, you will bind the JavaScript files to the `OnPress` of each button.

In `Main.page`, select **Open SAP Mobile Cards** button. In the Properties pane, click the **Events** tab, click the **link icon** for the `Handler` property to open the object browser.

Double Click on the `OpenSAPMobileCards.js` and click **OK** to set it as the `OnPress` action.

![MDK](img_014.gif)

Repeat the same and do the following:

Set the handler for **Open SAP Fiori Client** button to `OpenSAPFioriClient.js`.

Set the handler for **Open UI5 App** button to `OpenUI5.js`.

Set the handler for **Open SAP.com page** button to `OpenSAPcom.js`.

Save the changes to `Main.page`.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]
