## Prerequisites
 - **Tutorials:** You have completed [Set Keyboard and Time Zone](http://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hxe-ua-keyboard-vm.html)

## Details
### You will learn
You'll learn how to start the server. At the end of this tutorial you'll have a running and configured SYSTEMDB database, and a running and configured tenant database. You'll be ready to test your installation, and install optional components.

This tutorial is available as a [video](https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2016/09/d2900513-8a7c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html).

This is an on-premise installation tutorial. Other installation methods are available. See [https://developers.sap.com/topics/sap-hana-express.resources.html#details](https://developers.sap.com/topics/sap-hana-express.resources.html#details).

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Note the VM IP address)]

The IP address of the VM is displayed on the login screen. Make a note of the IP address, since you'll need it in future steps.

> If the IP address and other information in this image does not show, wait few seconds and press `Enter`.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ]((Optional) Repair bridge networking)]

![loio3568451438e74dd287e9dc0d9cdfc32e_HiRes](loio3568451438e74dd287e9dc0d9cdfc32e_HiRes.png)

If you are using a `VMWare` product, and if the IP address still doesn't show after one minute, you may have a `VMWare` bridge networking problem. If your system has several network adapters, `VMWare` can sometimes assign the incorrect adapter to the network connection designed for bridge networking – `VMNet0`. This prevents the IP address from displaying. Use the procedure in this step to troubleshoot bridge networking for `VMNet0`. If the IP address displays normally, skip to step 3.

1.  Download and install `VMWare` Workstation Pro 15. A free 30-day evaluation edition is available. Restart your host machine.

2.  Open the Virtual Network Editor (`vmnetcfg.exe`) application from the Windows *Start* menu, or from `C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation`.

    ![loio495ccd916fc44d1ba125dfe761a4aa53_HiRes](loio495ccd916fc44d1ba125dfe761a4aa53_HiRes.png)

3.  Click the *Change Settings* button. Bridged connections show.

    ![loiobfc3c01c8cc946798798ff9c6706b600_HiRes](loiobfc3c01c8cc946798798ff9c6706b600_HiRes.png)

4.  Check that `VMNet0` shows at the top of the list. Under `VMNet` Information, select *Bridged*. From the *Bridged to* list, select the correct network adapter.
5.  Click *Apply* and *OK* to save your corrected bridge networking values.
6.  Exit Virtual Network Editor.
7.  Exit your virtual machine.
8.  Restart you host machine.
9.  Restart SAP HANA, express edition and go back to step 1.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Log in)]

At the *`hxehost` login* prompt, enter `hxeadm`.

For *Password*, enter the temporary password `HXEHana1`.

![loio691e85dbc5514eedb49a0eabab8d5d72_LowRes](loio691e85dbc5514eedb49a0eabab8d5d72_LowRes.png)

When prompted for *(current) UNIX password*, enter the temporary password again: `HXEHana1`

![loio834fa6b3ab6546f4ac282a73885ccfba_LowRes](loio834fa6b3ab6546f4ac282a73885ccfba_LowRes.png)

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Enter new password)]

When prompted for *New password*, enter a strong password with at least 8 characters. If your password is not strong enough, the system logs you off and you must log in again.

> Note:
> SAP HANA, express edition requires a `very strong password` -- even stronger than other editions of SAP HANA. Your password must comply with these rules:
>
> -   At least 8 characters
> -   At least 1 uppercase letter
> -   At least 1 lowercase letter
> -   At least 1 number
> -   Can contain special characters, but not backtick, `$` (dollar sign), `\` (backslash), `'` (single quote), or `"` (double quotes)
> -   Cannot contain simplistic or systematic values, like strings in ascending or descending numerical or alphabetical order
>
>

Strong password example: `E15342GcbaFd`. Do not use this password example, since it is public and not secure. This example is for illustrative purposes only and must not be used on your system. Define your own strong password.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Retype new password)]

When prompted to *Retype new password*, enter your strong password again.

![loio22a8e2fa367c451896bb7dae2fe8629e_LowRes](loio22a8e2fa367c451896bb7dae2fe8629e_LowRes.png)

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Enter new HANA database master password)]

When prompted for *New HANA database master password*, enter a strong password. Make a note of this password, since you'll need it later. You can enter the same password you used in step 3, or a new password. If you are entering a new password, see the password rules in step 3.

Entering the HANA database master password changes the SYSTEM user password. If you are installing the `server + applications virtual machine`, it also changes the `XSA_ADMIN` and `XSA_DEV` user passwords.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Confirm HANA database master password)]

When prompted to *Confirm "HANA database master password"*, enter the strong password again.

![loioa56891abbf2144ff802f51e0ff1d23ba_LowRes](loioa56891abbf2144ff802f51e0ff1d23ba_LowRes.png)

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Complete the installation)]

When prompted to *Proceed with configuration?* enter `Y`.

Wait for the success message *Congratulations! SAP HANA, express edition 2.0 is configured.*

SAP HANA 2.0, express edition is now running.

> Note:
> If the success message does not display, does this line appear in your system output?
>
> ```bash
> Fail to retrieve certificate.
> ```
>
> If you see this message, you might have a problem with `VMWare` bridge networking configuration. See step 2.
>

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 9: ](Test XSC)]

1.  Edit the `/etc/hosts` file. See [Edit the Hosts File](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hxe-ua-hosts.html).

2.  Check that the `XSEngine` is running. From your host OS (not the VM guest) open a browser and enter:

    ```bash
    http://<hxehost IP address>:8090
    ```

    You recorded the IP address earlier. A success page displays. This indicates that XSC is running:

    ![loio511f9acd6591413db454e05b8dc8368c_HiRes](loio511f9acd6591413db454e05b8dc8368c_HiRes.png)

    > Note:
    > SAP plans to remove SAP HANA extended application services, classic model (XSC) and the corresponding SAP HANA Repository with the next major product version of SAP HANA.
    >
    > These components will be removed:
    >
    > -   SAP HANA extended application services, classic model
    >
    > -   SAP HANA Repository (XS classic)
    >
    > -   SAP HANA Studio (Development, Modeling, and Administration perspectives)
    >
    > -   SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench (XS classic)
    >
    > SAP strongly advises you to plan the transition of existing content and applications from XSC to SAP HANA extended application services, advanced model (XS Advanced).

**Next steps:**

-   **Drivers and connectors for Python, Node.js, .NET, Java and others** – check sample applications using different drivers and languages (such as Node.js, and Python). See [Create Tiny World App in SAP HANA, express edition](https://developers.sap.com/group.hxe-tiny-world.html).

-   **Database clients** – Use a SQL client and the JDBC drivers to connect to the database. See [Download a SQL client and connect to your instance (SAP HANA, express edition, server-only)](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hxe-cj1-download-sql-client.html). Alternately, use a plugin for Eclipse to connect to your SAP HANA, express edition system database instance. See [How to download and install the HANA Eclipse plugin](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hxe-howto-eclipse.html).
