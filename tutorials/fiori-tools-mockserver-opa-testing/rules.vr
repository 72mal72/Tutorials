###Question
What is the advantage of passing internal names of fields, sections, etc. as parameters to test functions?

[x] Using internal names avoids the risk of having multiple controls identified by the test function.
[x] There are no language-dependent problems to be expected related to the identification of UI controls when using internal names.
