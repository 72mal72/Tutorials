[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](Log into SAP Cloud Platform)]

Start by [logging into SAP Cloud Platform](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/).

>If you don't have an account on SAP Cloud Platform yet, go to the [Get a Free Trial Account on SAP Cloud Platform](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) tutorial, and then come back to this step.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]
[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](Select account type)]

The opening screen will appear.  Choose **Cloud Foundry Trial** as the type of account.

![Click the Cloud Foundry Trial button](2a.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]
[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](Select region for trial account)]

Clicking on the Cloud Foundry trial link will bring up the **Start Cloud Foundry Trial** dialog box.  Choose one of regions from this list.    

> We suggest the *Europe (Frankfurt)* region because it has the largest list of services.  If you want to use a region closer to you, [check to be certain it has the services you want before selecting it](https://help.sap.com/doc/aa1ccd10da6c4337aa737df2ead1855b/Cloud/en-US/3b642f68227b4b1398d2ce1a5351389a.html?3b642f68227b4b1398d2ce1a5351389a.html).

![Choose a nearby region](2b.png)

You will then see a dialog box while the account is set up.  When complete, the dialog box will look like this.  Click **Go To Space** to continue.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](Learn about Applications and Service Marketplace tabs)]

A Cloud Foundry space is the logical container of your runtime artefacts such as **Applications**, and **Service Instances**.

The **Applications** tab is where all of your applications will be listed, and new applications can be added in to your Cloud Foundry runtime environment.  

![The Applications Tab](6a.png)

The **Service Marketplace** is where you can find services to attach to any of your applications.  These services are provided by SAP Cloud Platform to make it easier to create, and produce, web applications quickly and easily. Once a service has been created, we call it a service instance.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]
[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](Navigate to the subaccount page)]

Use the breadcrumb navigation control to get to the subaccount page

The trial account contains **one** subaccount and space.  The details of subaccounts and spaces will be discussed in later tutorials.

For now, click on the **trial** subaccount.

![Select trial subaccount](4.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]
[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](Navigate to the Spaces page)]

Once you are in the subaccount, there is one more step to get back to your working area, or **Space**.  

Start by clicking on the **Spaces** box in the right navigation bar.
Next, click on the **dev** space box to open your working space.

![Click on the dev space to move to the correct space](5.png)

Now, you should be in the area you've been earlier, labeled **Space: dev - Applications**

You are now set up to use the Cloud Foundry systems on SAP Cloud Platform.

[DONE]
