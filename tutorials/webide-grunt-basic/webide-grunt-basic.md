## Details
### You will learn  
- How to configure your project for running a Grunt build
- How to run a Grunt build

SAP Web IDE Full-Stack comes with the Grunt task runner already part of the IDE, so you can run tasks by:

- Specifying dependencies in the `package.json` file.
- Specifying/defining tasks in the `Gruntfile.js` file.  

Once you've created these files, you get a new menu option called **Build** to start the grunt tasks. You don't specify a task; SAP Web IDE Full-Stack always runs the `default` task that you have defined in the `Gruntfile.js`.

### Before you begin
For this tutorial, make sure:

- You are using **SAP Web IDE Full-Stack**
- You have created an SAPUI5 project. You can simply create a blank or sample project from a template.
- Your project uses the Basic JavaScript validator. To change it, right-click your project and go to **Project Settings** | **Code Checking** | **JavaScript**, change the validator to **Basic JavaScript**, and click **Save**.

The `grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-build` Grunt plugin is published on the SAP npm registry. To run the Grunt build using this plugin outside of SAP Web IDE for Full-Stack development, such as from a CLI as part of the CI process, use npm version 5.7.1 or later and add the following configuration option to the npm configuration file:

`@sap:registry=https://npm.sap.com/`

For more information, see [`npmrc: The npm config files`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/npmrc).

> Please note the following:
<ul>
<li>The Grunt build currently supports the ES6 edition of the ECMAScript standard. The ES6 edition is only supported from the 1.3.65 version of the Grunt best-practice build.</li>
<li>Newer ECMAScript standards, such as ES6, work with SAPUI5 only in browsers with HTML5 capabilities. For more information, see [Browser and Platform Support](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/74b59efa0eef48988d3b716bd0ecc933) in the SAPUI5 documentation.</li></ul>

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create a package.json file)]
Right-click your project and choose **New** | **File**, enter `package.json`.

![Create package.json](grunt-Step1-newfile.png)

In the file, enter the following code:

```JSON
{
  "name": "grunt-build",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "Grunt build",
  "private": true,
  "devDependencies": {
      "@sap/grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-build": "1.3.65"
   }
}
```

![Create package.json](grunt-Step1-newfile2.png)

Later, when you select **Build** in the context menu, these settings instruct npm to install Grunt and the `gruntsapui5-bestpractice-build` Grunt plugin that contains tasks for building your SAPUI5 project.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create a Gruntfile.js file)]
Right-click your project and choose **New** | **File**, enter `Gruntfile.js`.

![Create Gruntfile.js](grunt-Step2-newfile.png)

To include the build tasks listed below, you need add the content below to the  `Gruntfile.js` file, according to the compatible version you want to define.

This first code content defines the `compatVersion` property for a specific SAPUI5 version using the two-digit format: **`"x.xx"`**.

```JavaScript
module.exports = function (grunt) {
            "use strict";
            grunt.loadNpmTasks("@sap/grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-build");
            grunt.config.merge({ compatVersion: "1.38" });
            grunt.registerTask("default", [
                        "clean",
                        "lint",
                        "build"
            ]);
            grunt.loadNpmTasks("@sap/grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-test");
            grunt.registerTask("unit_and_integration_tests", ["test"]);
            grunt.config.merge({
                        coverage_threshold: {
                                    statements: 0,
                                    branches: 100,
                                    functions: 0,
                                    lines: 0
                        }
            });
};

```

For modules created using the HTML5 Application Repository service, enter the content below. Here the `compatVersion` property is defined as **`"edge"`**, which is based on the SAP Innovation SAPUI5 version.

```JavaScript
module.exports = function (grunt) {
                "use strict";
                grunt.loadNpmTasks("@sap/grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-build");
                grunt.config.merge({
                                compatVersion: "edge",
                                deploy_mode: "html_repo"
                });
                grunt.registerTask("default", [
                                "clean",
                                "lint",
                                "build"
                ]);
                grunt.loadNpmTasks("@sap/grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-test");
                grunt.registerTask("unit_and_integration_tests", ["test"]);
                grunt.config.merge({
                                coverage_threshold: {
                                                statements: 0,
                                                branches: 100,
                                                functions: 0,
                                                lines: 0
                                }
                });
};

```

>The test task for the SAP Web IDE best practice build can only be triggered from the CLI. Triggering the test task for the build from SAP Web IDE will cause the build to fail. For instructions for running automated testing from the CLI, see [Grunt Build Troubleshooting](https://help.sap.com/viewer/825270ffffe74d9f988a0f0066ad59f0/CF/en-US/9202f1fc0adb40b68adaa8ba31053724.html).

The code above does the following:

- Loads the tasks from the SAPUI5 best practices Grunt plugin.

- Sets the default task to execute the following tasks defined in the SAPUI5 plugin:

    |Task&nbsp;&nbsp;            |Description       |
    |---------------|-------|
    | `lint`        | Validates the project code using ESLint according to the rules defined in the `.eslintrc` configuration file located in the root of your project.      |
    | `clean`       | Cleans the `dist` target folder from the previous build results.      |
    | `build`       | Produces a new build output in the `dist` folder of your project that is ready and optimized for better performance in the productive environment.

The following tasks are executed during the build:

  - Minification of `.css` files.

  - Minification of JavaScript files (minified files).

  - Copying of the original files to the `dist` folder with `-dbg` suffix added for debugging purposes.

  - Generation of the `Component-preload.js` and `Component-preload-dbg.js` preload files for the debug and minified files.

  - Minification of the preload file.

  - Generation of the `CachebusterInfo.json` file.

  - Generation of the `changes-bundle.json` file. The file contains a collection of all the changes that are made to an SAP Fiori element application and are located in the `changes` folder.

    > The changes will only be displayed if you are using SAPUI5 version 1.52 and higher. If you are using an older SAPUI5 version, do not bundle the changes. For a list of tasks to execute when creating a build with an older SAPUI5 version, see [Grunt Build Troubleshooting](https://help.sap.com/viewer/825270ffffe74d9f988a0f0066ad59f0/CF/en-US/9202f1fc0adb40b68adaa8ba31053724.html).

  - Generation of the `manifest-bundle.zip` file, which contains the `manifest.json` and `i18n` files.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Build your project)]

Right-click your project and choose **Build**.

![Create package.json](grunt-Step3-build.png)

When the build finishes, a new `dist` folder is created in your project and is automatically added to `.gitignore`, ensuring that the folder is not checked into the project's Git repository.

![Create package.json](grunt-Step3-dist.png)

You can see any build errors in the console, which you can display by going to **View** | **Console**.

![Create package.json](grunt-Step3-console.png)

>A new `package-lock.json` file is added to your project (unless it already existed). It is a special file that `npm` uses for locking the version of each package in the dependency tree, including the final resolved versions of ranges such as ~1.7.0 or ^1.0.9. If your project is connected to Git, commit and push the file to your Git repository.

<br>

> ### Tip
 If the build fails, do one of the following according to the failure reported in the console:

>  - **ERROR**: `Unable to locate local Grunt`
>
    Right-click the project folder in the workspace, select **Clean npm Folder**, and build again.
    This option removes the node-modules folder that is automatically created by npm. For more information, see <https://docs.npmjs.com/files/folders>. After the build finishes, this folder is not displayed in your project, but is stored by the SAP Web IDE Full-Stack build infrastructure.
>
  - **ERROR**: `npm ERR! code EINTEGRITY`
>
    Delete your `package-lock.json` file from the project and run the build again.
