[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Add a data model)]

The `data-model.cds` file is a Core Data Services (CDS) document. CDS  documents are design-time source files that contain DDL code that describes a persistence model according to rules defined in CDS. This documents are used to create corresponding data objects. In this case, the entity `Bike` will be a data structure to be store in a `CSV` file, but it could be also a table in a database.

1. Open the `db/data-model.cds` and replace the existing content with the following CDS definitions:

    ```CDS
    namespace starter.sample.suite;

    entity Bike {

      key productUID : String;
      productType  : String;
      variantType  : String;
      baseProductUID  : String;
      catalogVersion  : String;
      name  : String;
      description  : String;
      superCategories  : String;
      unit:String;
      price:Double;
      currency: String;
      attributeHeader1  : String;
      attributeValue1  : String;
      attributeHeader2  : String;
      attributeValue2  : String;
      image		: String;
    }
    ```

    ![Define the data model](define-data-model.png)

2. Save the file.

3. Go to `db/src` and open the context menu. Create a new folder named `csv`.

4. In your new `csv` folder, open the context menu and create a new file named `Bike.csv`.

5. Open `Bike.csv` and replace the template with the following data:

    ```CSV

    ```

    ![Define csv](Define-csv.png)

    This file contains the data that is loaded into the HANA table.

6. Save the file.    

7. Stay inside your `csv` folder, open the context menu, and create a new file named `Data.hdbtabledata`.

8. Open `Data.hdbtabledata` and replace the template with the following CDS definitions:

    ```CDS
    {
    	"format_version": 1,
    	"imports": [
    		{
    			"target_table": "STARTER_SAMPLE_SUITE_BIKE",
    			"source_data": {
    			"data_type": "CSV",
    				"file_name": "Bike.csv",
    				"has_header": true
    			},
    			"import_settings": {
    			"import_columns": [
    				"PRODUCTUID",
    				"PRODUCTTYPE",
    				"VARIANTTYPE",
    				"BASEPRODUCTUID",
    				"CATALOGVERSION",
    				"NAME",
    				"DESCRIPTION",
    				"SUPERCATEGORIES",
    				"UNIT",
    				"PRICE",
    				"CURRENCY",
    				"ATTRIBUTEHEADER1",
    				"ATTRIBUTEVALUE1",
    				"ATTRIBUTEHEADER2",
    				"ATTRIBUTEVALUE2"
    				]
    			}
    		}

    	]
    }
    ```

    ![Define hdbtabledata](Define-hdbtabledata.png)


    This file contains the mapping of the HANA table and its corresponding `csv` files.

9. Save the file.    

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Update Your service module)]

1. Go to `srv/my-service.cds` and right-click your `my-service.cds` and rename it to `bikeService.cds`

2. Double-click `bikeService.cds` and replace the template with the following CDS definitions:

    ```CDS
    //we have defined a Service called CatalogService that contains a single Entity called Bike.
    //The Bike Entity allows the read method to be performed on a projection of the database table suite.Bike

    using {starter.sample.suite} from '../db/data-model';

    service CatalogService {
     entity Bike @readonly as projection on suite.Bike;
    }
    ```
    >This is the file where we define the OData service that we want to expose. In this case, the Bike entity is defined as read only.

3. Save the file.    

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Add a database)]

1. Right-click the **`db`** module and choose **Build**.

    ![Build the db module](build-db.png)

2. Wait for the notification that says the **Build** was successful.

> If the build is unsuccessful, check the console log for errors. Errors similar to this one: `Warning: Could not find a configured library that contains the "com.sap.hana.di.afllangprocedure" build plugin in a version compatible to version 2.0.30.0 at "src/.hdiconfig"` can be addressed as follows:

> 1. Ensure all files in the project are shown, with menu path **View** | **Show Hidden Files**.

> 1. Expand the folder `db/src/` to find the file `.hdiconfig`.                    
![finding the hdiconfig file](finding-hdiconfig.png)

> 1. Open the file and check the value of the `plugin_version` property at the top of the file. It needs to be `2.0.2.0`.

> 1. Change the value to `2.0.2.0` if necessary. Be careful to maintain the structure and integrity of the rest of the file (basically, just change the value inside the double quotes).

> 1. **Save** the file and retry the **Build**.



[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Build and run your service)]

1. Right click on the **`srv`** module and choose **Build**.


    ![Build the srv module](build-srv.png)

    Wait for the notification that says the **Build** was successful.

2. Click on the **`srv`** module and choose **Run** from the global toolbar.


    ![Choose Run](run-java-app.png)

    >This might take a few minutes because a new cloud container has to be initialized and started. Subsequent restarts are much faster because hot deployment is used.

3. Go to the **Run Console** and click on the URL.

    ![Run console](run-console.png)

    A new browser window opens containing a link to the OData service.

4. Click on the service link to open the OData service document.

5. Add **`/$metadata`** to the URL and refresh.

    The OData metadata document opens in EDMX format.

6. Replace `/$metadata` with **`/Bike`**. You can now see the data from the `Bike.csv` that is loaded into the HANA table, which is exposed via the application.

7. Replace `/Bike` with **`/Bike('MZ-FG-E104')`** to see the bike details sorted by ID.

8. Replace `/Bike('MZ-FG-E104')` with **`/Bike?$filter=price gt 200 and price lt 1000`** to retrieve the bikes in the price range between 200 and 1000.

9. Replace `/Bike?$filter=price gt 200 and price lt 1000` with **`/Bike?$filter=name eq 'Velotics X-Country'`** to retrieve the bikes sorted by name.
